12/6/21 Regrade - SC 
Looks great, Andy, thanks! 6/6


Hi Andy, 

I can't give you a grade on this right now. I can't really see what you did in your commands, so I can't give feedback on how to better address the problems I'm noticing before. 
Can you resubmit your commands with more formatting so I can more easily see the steps and flags you used for each. 

-- I don't think the plots are correct - the numbers for G1E and ER4 should be different (-1). Also, can you try to get them on the same plot?  
-- You're missing the plot for regions gained or lost (i.e., G1E only or ER4 only) which should be another portion of the same plot (see assignment) (-1) 
-- Your sequence motif looks off - go over your process for selecting the motifs you're including (-1)
