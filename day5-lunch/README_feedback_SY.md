### Comments

Great: Great job making it to the advanced exercises! I see you did a bit of data exploration with gender too. Your section headings for the main assignment are great and do most of the documenting for you.

To improve: Maybe label PC1 and PC2 as the axes of your PCA plots.

Python code
Allele frequency spectrum plot
