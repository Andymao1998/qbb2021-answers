- Regrade 12/13/21 - thanks for adding those, 5/5 

Hi Andy, 
- I don't see your IGV screenshot (-1) 
- I don't see your command line (i.e., bismark and bedtools) work (-2) 
- For both the histograms and the scatter, think about whether changing the axes lengths could make the plots more informative 

2/5
