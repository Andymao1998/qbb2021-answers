### Comments

Great: Awesome comments on the biology.

To improve: It would be great to have more cleaned up documentation of the command-line commands - including just the command, not all the stuff before the `$`. Example:

```
cp /Users/cmdb/qbb2021/data/*.bed day1-lunch
$wc -l *.bed > directory.txt
```

### Completion:

Found:
README with code
directory.txt
feature_count.txt
fbgenes.info
chr-with-fbgenes-k9.txt

Missing:
n/a
