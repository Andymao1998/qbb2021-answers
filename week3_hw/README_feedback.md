Hi Andy, 
- For the Manhattans, we'd like you to label with rsID the top 5 most significant SNPs (-0.25) 
- For the qqplots, I'm not sure you've plotted the data correctly. It may be an artifact of the `qqplot` method you used, and while itâ€™s great to use packages when appropriate, the packages you use need to generate figures that meet the specifications of exactly what you want.
Can you try to re-do these and hope for better fit along the line? (Maybe consider adjusting the x and y axis positions that are shown) (-0.25)
- For the boxplot, can you get all plots on the same grid? 

6.25/7
