Minor comment on the heatmap:  you'll want to set the xlimits on the eigenvector plot so that they stretch to the edge of the plot. Your violin plots look essentially correct, but I'm not sure I fully understand how you calculated the compartment for each gene. We had initially asked you to upload the command line commands you used (i.e. bedtools map). (-0.5)
