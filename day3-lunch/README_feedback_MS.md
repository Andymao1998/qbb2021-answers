Overall it is clear that you understand how the different parts of python work and how to put them together to perform some more complicated code. 

Your code is REALLY well commented. My only thought is that it is hard to read the code and comments together since I have to keep scrolling back and forth. Convention is to write the comment on the line before for exactly this reason (readability).

In the while statement condition, you could shorten that to `while not condition` if you wanted. And since condition is only used to indicate that the while loop is done, why not use a boolean?

Given that you convert them to ints everywhere they get used, why not convert mid, high, and lo to ints when they get their assignments?

One thing to watch out for when writing code is rare (edge) cases. For example, what would your code do if the gene line only had one gene? Making generalized code capabable of handling any situation with properly formatted data will make it more useful and thinking about how to do that will make you a great programmer instead of a good one.

Great job. keep it up!
