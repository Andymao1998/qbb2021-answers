2b. I think you sorted alphabetically (i.e. on column 1) rather than numerically on column 2 (-0.25)
2c. Hmm I'm curious how you got this. Not the same numbers I haveâ€¦
4c. There should only be 1 insertion, but  it is 712 bp long (-0.25)
Make sure you answer the questions in order (just to make grading easier) and that you don't miss any questions. I think you missed 5b. (-0.1)

4.4/5
